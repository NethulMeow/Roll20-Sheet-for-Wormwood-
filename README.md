Roll20 Sheet for Wormwood

Taken from the evil hat github for current roll20 Blades in the dark sheets.

This Hack will be themed for a small country town in America and isnt intended for people outside of my circle of friends to use. use the sheets at your own risk

i also need to atribute the two icons i borrowed for the logo.
